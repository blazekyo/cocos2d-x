***Notes: Whenever you see a ":" meaning it's a command you enter in command prompt. whenever you see a "/*" it's a comment. Whenever you see #### is a title, #1 is steps numbering***

####Creating new python environment####
#1 Open your command prompt.
#2 :conda create -n py27 python=2.7 anaconda /*py27 is a name of the environment

####Activating python environment and check python version####
#1 :activate py27 /*you'll see your command prompt cursor changed to (py27)
#2 :python -u /*you should be able to see Python 2.7.13 ....

####Building Cocos2d in Windows(only tested in window 8)####
###Clone Repository into SCCGroupProject###
#1 :cd C://
#2 :mkdir SCCGroupProject
#3 :cd SCCGroupProject
#4 :git clone https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x.git /*this clone is incompleted, if you notice, the folder which have weird strings like plugin @ 0fb74e5 or web @ 15704c3 when you checked on your folder plugin and web, they are empty. Hence you will have to git clone them one by one.
#5 Those folder which are affected are "plugin, web, tools/binding-generator, cocos2d-console" /*make sure you git clone them all individually(one by one)
###Download SDK, NDK and ANT###
#1 download ndk from >> https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/index.html
#2 download sdk from >> https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html /*download android studio, the sdk folder is located in user/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
#3 download Ant from >> https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi /*version 1.10.1 should do
#4 After download, copied and extract the Ndk and Ant Archieves in the SCCGroupProject Folder.
###Running Cocos2d Setup.py###
#1 :cd c://SCCGroupProject/cocos2d-x /*move to the cocos2d-x directory
#2 :activate py27 /* activate the python 2.7 environment, the cocos2d requires python ver 2.7
#3 :python Setup.py 
#4 after the command, it will prompt you the root directory of sdk, ndk and Ant path. For NDK and Ant just use the path in the c://SCCGRoupProject folder you just extracted. For Sdk, use the path of the folder in Android Studio, eg: users/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk
#5 after the configuration, restart your command prompt.
###Build and Run Cocos###
#1 :cd c://SCCGroupProject/cocos2d-x/tools/cocos2d-console/bin 
#2 :activate py27 
#3 :cocos /* if success you should see Available Command: ... ... ... Example: ... ...
#4 Congratz ! Now you can follow the instruction on how to build a new project using cocos in >> https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x
#5 Have fun
